# MOONs
Repository containing the code for MOONS (Multi-Object Optical and Near-infrared Spectrograph) collision avoidance.

## Introduction
The Multi Object Optical and Near-infrared Spectrograph for the VLT (MOONS) is a multi-scope instrument that is also aiming to probe galactic archaelogy, galaxy evolution and cosmology. It will obtain near infrared spectra for millions of stars and galaxies.

MOONS will be installed on the VLT 8-meter telescope at Paranal Observatory in 2019. MOONS is a european project led by the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh.

The MOONS fiber system will consistutes of 1000 fiber-positioning actuators following an hexagonal distribution on the focal plane with a ~3cm distance between actuators (center to center).

This project involves groups from different countries (Switzerland, USA, Scotland, Italy...etc). In europa, at least for the collision avoidance, different people are involved:
- EPFL: collision avoidance 
- Italy: responsible for creating the OPS file, a files defining the position in the focal space for each positioners and their target, and also assigning the parity and target to each positioner
- Scotland: Leader of this project

At the EPFL, Prof. Jean-Paul Kneib, is the head of this project.
 He is supported by Dr. Mohamed Bouri, head of the Laboratoire de Syst√®mes Robotiques (LSRO) lab and Dr. Denis Gillet, head of the REACT lab.
